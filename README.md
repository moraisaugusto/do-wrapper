# do-wrapper
### A Javascript wrapper for the Digital Ocean v2 API

### Notes

This is a fork from matt-major/do-wrapper. Main differ is the replacement of request library to axios (works directly on Browser).

### Install

To install ```do-wrapper``` just add dist files on your html.


### Documentation
All methods are documented. You can generate the API docs using the following command.

```sh
$ npm run doc
```

You can then open `doc/index.html` to view the API documentation.

Alternatively, you can view the generated markdown docs here:
* [Digital Ocean](docs/do-wrapper.md)
* [Request Helper](docs/request-helper.md)
